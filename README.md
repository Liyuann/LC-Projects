Here are the machine learning projects that I created for school work. The projects are:

1. Evaluating required skills for data analysts by web-scraping job postings and analyzing using N-grams and clustering techniques
2. Corporate credit rating prediction using multi-class Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Neural Network
3. Cyclist detection using custom YOLOv8 model and pre-trained SSD MobileNetV3 model
4. NLP: Ukraineâ€™s image in the world stage since 2022 using Natural Language Processing (NLP) skills including sentiment analysis and BERT model
5. Stock price prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
